<P>The list which follows was taken from the database of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (the Commission) on 30 August 1998. It contains the names of all those people who, by that date, had been found by the Commission to have suffered a gross violation of human rights. The cut-off date of 30 August was necessary in order that the list could be checked and prepared for inclusion in this report.</P>

<P>If people do not find their name on this list, there is no cause for concern. There are thousands more names to come, because the process of making finding and of dealing with queries, reviews and appeals has continued beyond that date. In addition, there will be further victims of human rights violations who will be identified through applications for amnesty.</P>

<P>It is the intention of the Commission to publish a complete list at a later date, as an addendum to this report. At that stage, the list will include not only names, but a brief summary of the finding made in every case.</P>
