<DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>1 &#9;During the period under review, the majority of South Africans were denied their fundamental rights, including the right to vote and the right to access to appropriate education, adequate housing, accessible health care and proper sanitation. Those who opposed apartheid were subjected to various forms of repression. Many organisations and individuals in opposition to the former state were banned and banished, protest marches were dispersed, freedom of speech was curtailed, and thousands were detained and imprisoned. This gave rise to tremendous frustration and anger amongst the disenfranchised. Soon, each act of repression by the state gave rise to a reciprocal act of resistance. The South African conflict spiralled out of control, resulting in horrific acts of violence and human rights abuses on all sides of the conflict. No section of society escaped these acts and abuses. </P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><LI>WHY REPARATION?</LI></UL>
<DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>2 &#9;Victims of human rights abuses have suffered a multiplicity of losses and therefore have the right to reparation. Without adequate reparation and rehabilitation measures, there can be no healing or reconciliation.</P>
<P>3 &#9;In addition, in the context of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, reparation is essential to counterbalance amnesty. The granting of amnesty denies victims the right to institute civil claims against perpetrators. The government should thus accept responsibility for reparation.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3></DIR>

<P>The legal basis for reparation</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>4 &#9;The Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act (the Act) mandates the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee of the Commission to provide, amongst other things, measures to be taken in order to grant reparation to victims of gross human rights violations (see below).</P>
<P>5 &#9;The legal authority for reparation is further entrenched in domestic law by the judgement in the case of the AZAPO and Others v The President of the Republic of South Africa and Others (1996(8) BCLR 1015 (CC), in which the applicants sought an order declaring section 20(7) of the Act unconstitutional. Section 20(7) states that a person who has been granted amnesty shall not be criminally or civilly liable in respect of that act. The court held that section 20(7) is not unconstitutional. In arriving at such decision Didcott J held at paragraph 62:</P></DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P> </P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>Reparation is usually payable by states, and there is no reason to doubt that the postscript envisages our own state shouldering the national responsibility for those. It therefore does not contemplate that the state will go Scot-free. On the contrary, I believe an actual commitment on the point is implicit in its terms, a commitment in principle to the assumption by the state of the burden. </P></DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>6 &#9;He stated further at paragraph 65: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P> </P>
<P>The Statute does not, it is true, grant any legally enforceable rights in lieu of those lost by claimants whom the amnesties hit. It nevertheless offers some quid pro quo for the loss and establishes the machinery for determining such alternative redress. I cannot see what else it might have achieved immediately once, in the light of the painful choices described by Mohammed DP and in the exercise of the legislative judgement brought to bear on them, the basic decision had been taken to substitute the indeterminate prospect of reparations for the concrete reality of legal claims wherever those were enjoyed. For nothing more definite, detailed and efficacious could feasibly have been promised at that stage, and with no prior investigations, recommendations and decisions of the very sort for which provision is now made.</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Review of the Act </P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>7 &#9;The Preamble to the Act, stipulates that one of the objectives of the Commission is to provide for: </P>
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>the taking of measures aimed at the granting of reparation to, and the rehabilitation and the restoration of the human and civil dignity, of victims of violations of human rights. </P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>8 &#9;Pursuant thereto, section 4(f) states that one of the functions of the Commission shall be to make recommendations to the President with regard to:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>the policy which should be followed or measures which should be taken with regard to the granting of reparation to victims or the taking of other measures aimed at rehabilitating and restoring the human and civil dignity of victims; measures which should be taken to grant Urgent Interim Reparation to victims.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>9 &#9;Furthermore, section 25(b)(i) stipulates that the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee may:</P>
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>make recommendations which may include urgent interim measures as contemplated in section 4(f)(ii), as to appropriate measures of reparation to victims.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>10 &#9;In terms of section 42, the State President, in consultation with the Ministers of Justice and Finance, will establish a President’s Fund. All money payable to victims in terms of regulations promulgated by the President shall be disbursed from this fund.</P></DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P> </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>International legal framework</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>11 &#9;The right of victims of human rights abuse to fair and adequate compensation is well established in international law. In the past three years, South Africa has signed a number of important international instruments, which place it under an obligation</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">1</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> to provide victims of human rights abuse with fair and adequate compensation. The provisions of these instruments, together with the rulings of those bodies established to ensure compliance with them, indicate that it is not sufficient to award ‘token’ or nominal compensation to victims. The amount of reparation awarded must be sufficient to make a meaningful and substantial impact on their lives. In terms of United Nations Conventions, there is well established right of victims of human rights abuse to compensation for their losses and suffering. It is important that the reparation policy adopted by the government, based on recommendations made by the Commission is in accordance with South Africa’s international obligations. The reparation awarded to victims must be significant.</P>
<P>12&#9;What follows is a brief review of international law in this regard.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

<B><I><P>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">2</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1> </P><DIR>

</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>13 &#9;Article 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted him by the constitution or by law.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>14 &#9;The use of the words &quot;effective remedy&quot; underscores the point that the reparation awarded must be meaningful and substantial.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</B></FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">3</I></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>  </P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>15 &#9;Section 3(a) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights reads:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><DIR>
<DIR>

<I><P>Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes:</P>

<P>(a)To ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognised are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>16&#9;The Human Rights Committee established under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to consider alleged breaches of the Covenant has considered a number of cases relating to the right to compensation arising from gross violations of human rights.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">4</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> In all these cases, it has been held that, where the state or any of its agents is responsible for killings, torture, abductions or disappearances, it is under a legal obligation to pay compensation to the victims or their families. The fact that, in the majority of instances, the Committee has used the term ‘compensation’ implies that the award to victims should be substantial.</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</B></FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial">5</I></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3> </P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>17&#9;The Committee against Torture, established to ensure compliance with the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, has found that complaints relating to acts of torture which occurred before the Convention entered into force are inadmissible because the Convention cannot be applied retroactively. Consequently, the Committee declared inadmissible a series of complaints by Argentinean citizens who alleged that they had been tortured before the Convention had come into force. Despite this rather technical finding, the Committee stressed in its communication to the government of Argentina that it should, in order to comply with the spirit of the Convention against Torture, ensure that victims of torture receive &quot;adequate compensation&quot;. This is another example of an international body requiring, not just token, but significant reparation to be made to victims of human rights abuse.</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>The Inter-American Conventions on Human Rights</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>18&#9;The Inter-American Convention on Human Rights contains provisions that grant victims of human rights abuse a right to compensation. In the famous Velasquez Rodriguez case</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">6</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>, the Inter-American Court held that a state is under an obligation to &quot;provide compensation as warranted for damages resulting from the violations [of the rights recognised by the Convention]&quot;. On numerous other occasions – most recently in 1992 with respect to the governments of Uruguay and Argentina – the Inter-American Court has reasserted its view that victims of human rights abuse are entitled to compensation . </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>The moral argument</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>19&#9;The South African conflict produced casualties. Many people were killed, tortured, abducted and subjected to various forms of severe ill treatment. This not only destroyed individual lives, but also affected families, communities and the nation as a whole.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">8</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> As a result, the new South Africa has inherited thousands of people whose lives have been severely affected. If we are to transcend the past and build national unity and reconciliation, we must ensure that those whose rights have been violated are acknowledged through access to reparation and rehabilitation. While such measures can never bring back the dead, nor adequately compensate for pain and suffering, they can and must improve the quality of life of the victims of human rights violations and/or their dependants. </P>
<P>20&#9;The present government has accepted that it is morally obliged to carry the debts of its predecessors and is thus equally responsible for reparation. Implementation of reparation will afford all South Africans an opportunity to contribute to healing and reconciliation.</P>
<P>21&#9;Without adequate reparation and rehabilitation measures, there can be no healing and reconciliation, either at an individual or a community level. Comprehensive forms of reparation should also be implemented to restore the physical and mental well being of victims. </P>
<P>22&#9;The following policy proposals and recommendations in respect of both urgent interim reparation and reparation itself are, therefore, submitted to the State President for his consideration in terms of sections 27 and 40(1)(d) of the Act.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>


<UL>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><LI>WHAT CONSTITUTES REPARATION AND REHABILITATION</LI></UL>
<DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>23&#9;Section 1(1) (xiv) of the Act defines reparation as including: &quot;any form of compensation, ex <I>gratia</I> payment, restitution, rehabilitation or recognition.&quot;</P>
<P>24&#9;The proposed reparation and rehabilitation policy has five components: </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Urgent Interim Reparation </P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>25&#9;Urgent interim reparation is assistance for people in urgent need, to provide them with access to appropriate services and facilities. It is recommended that limited financial resources be made available to facilitate this access. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Individual Reparation Grants </P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>26&#9;This is an individual financial grant scheme. It is recommended that each victim of a gross human rights violation receive a financial grant, according to various criteria, paid over a period of six years. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Symbolic reparation/legal and administrative measures</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>27&#9;Symbolic reparation encompasses measures to facilitate the communal process of remembering and commemorating the pain and victories of the past.</P>
<P>28&#9;Amongst other measures, symbolic reparation should entail identifying a national day of remembrance and reconciliation, erection of memorials and monuments, and the development of museums. </P>
<P>29&#9;Legal and administrative measures will also be proposed to assist individuals to obtain death certificates, expedite outstanding legal matters and expunge criminal records. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3></DIR>

<P>Community rehabilitation programmes</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>30&#9;The Commission consulted with relevant government ministries in preparing its proposals for the establishment of community-based services and activities, aimed at promoting the healing and recovery of individuals and communities that have been affected by human rights violations.</P>
<P>31&#9;During the life of the Commission, a number of victims were referred to the relevant government departments for assistance. It is recommended that this process continue after the Commission closes. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3></DIR>

<P>Institutional reform</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>32&#9;These proposals include legal, administrative and institutional measures designed to prevent the recurrence of human rights abuses. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>


<UL>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><LI>WHO IS ENTITLED TO REPARATION AND REHABILITATION? </LI></UL>
<DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>33&#9;It is recommended that the recipients of urgent interim reparation and individual reparation grants should be victims as found by the Commission, as well as their relatives and dependants who are found to be in urgent need, after the consideration of a completed prescribed application form, according to the proposed urgency criteria.</P>
<P>34&#9;For the purposes of this policy, the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee (chapter 1 of the Act) defines relatives and dependants of a victim as:</P>
<P>&#9;a &#9;parents (or those who acted/act in place of a parent);</P>
<P>&#9;b &#9;spouse (according to customary, common, religious or indigenous law);</P>
<P>&#9;c &#9;children (either in or out of wedlock or adopted);</P>
<P>&#9;d &#9;someone the victim has/had a customary or legal duty to support. </P>
<P>35&#9;It should be noted that, if the victim died as the result of the violation, the definition of relatives and dependants will apply to the situation <I>at the time of the victim’s death</I>. If the victim is alive, the definition will apply to the situation as at 14 December 1997.</P>

<UL>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><LI>REPARATION AND REHABILITATION POLICY DEVELOPMENT </LI></UL>
<DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>36&#9;In formulating these policies and recommendations, the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee collected information from a variety of sources. Specifically, the Committee collected information from victims and survivors, representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and community based organisations (CBOs), faith communities and academic institutions. Consultative workshops were held throughout the country. The information collected from deponents was processed and coded in the Commission database and assisted the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee to:</P>
<P>&#9;a &#9;establish harm suffered;</P>
<P>&#9;b &#9;determine the needs and expectations of victims;</P>
<P>&#9;c &#9;establish criteria to identify victims in urgent need;</P>
<P>&#9;d &#9;develop proposals regarding long term reparation and rehabilitation measures. </P>
<P>37&#9;The Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee was also guided by internationally accepted approaches to reparation and rehabilitation:</P>
<P>&#9;a &#9;redress: the right to fair and adequate compensation;</P>
<P>&#9;b &#9;restitution: the right to the re-establishment, as far as possible, of the situation that existed prior to the violation;</P>
<P>&#9;c &#9;rehabilitation: the right to the provision of medical and psychological care and fulfilment of significant personal and community needs;</P>
<P>&#9;d &#9;restoration of dignity: the right of the individual/community to a sense of worth; and</P>
<P>&#9;e &#9;reassurance of non-repetition: the strategies for the creation of legislative and administrative measures that contribute to the maintenance of a stable society and the prevention of the re-occurrence of human rights violations.</P>
<P>38&#9;Policy development was also informed by the work and recommendations of other Truth Commissions, in particular the Chilean Commission, which awarded a ‘pension’ to the families of the dead and disappeared; by the decision of the United Nations to award financial compensation to the victims of the Iran-Iraq war; and, most pertinently, by the conclusions of the Skweyiya and Motsuenyane Commissions.</P>
<P>39&#9;The Skweyiya Commission</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">9</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> recommended that victims of &quot;maltreatment during detention&quot; should receive monetary compensation, appropriate medical and psychological assistance, assistance in completing interrupted education and compensation for property lost. The Motsuenyane Commission</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">10</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> also recommended compensation to those who suffered human rights violations and assistance with medical expenses.</P>
<P>40&#9;In the process of developing policy, the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee was faced with a number of decisions. Perhaps the most important of these was whether reparation should be financial and, if so, how much money should be given.</P>
<P>41&#9;The alternative to a financial grant would be a ‘service package’. Offering a service package has a number of pitfalls:</P><DIR>

<P>a &#9;The costs of administering the process might reduce the amount available to victims.</P>
<P>b &#9;Victims’ needs change over time. Thus, a service package tailored to meet present needs could well be inappropriate after a period.</P>
<P>c &#9;Dependants’ needs (and status) also change over time.</P>
<P>d &#9;Giving preferential access to services to select individuals in a community could give rise to tensions.</P>
<P>e &#9;The way in which a distant implementing body chooses to service a need may not be the way the individual would have chosen him or herself.</P></DIR>

<P>42&#9;The Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee decided that a well-structured monetary grant would be preferable to a services package, providing it took two things into account:</P><DIR>

<P>a &#9;It should enable reasonable access to essential basic services.</P>
<P>b &#9;It should generate opportunities to achieve a dignified standard of living within the South African socio-economic context.</P></DIR>

<P>43&#9;A monetary package also gives freedom of choice to the recipient. He or she can use the money in a way that is most appropriate to redress the injustice experienced. Because a monetary package provides government with a set of predictable, limited expenses, it makes fiscal management more feasible. An appropriately organised package requires minimal bureaucratic oversight. </P>
<P>44&#9;The final, and most important factor in favour of an individual monetary grant, was that analysis of a representative sample of statements revealed that most deponents requested reparation in the form of money or services that money can purchase (see Figure RR1). The highest expectation of the reparation process was for monetary assistance. Compensation, bursaries, shelter, medical care and tombstones occupied third to seventh places respectively in the most frequent requests (the second most commonly requested intervention was for investigation of the violation).</P>
<P>45&#9;For all these reasons, it was decided to recommend the provision of urgent interim reparations and individual reparation grants in the form of money.</P>

<LI>PRINCIPLES OF REPARATION AND REHABILITATION POLICY</LI></UL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>
<P>Development-centred</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>46&#9;This policy is development-centred. Central to the approach is a focus on resources, knowledge and choice. Development is not about provision of resources to passive individuals, but rather about actively empowering individuals and communities to take control of their own lives. In adherence to this principle, it is essential to provide individuals with sufficient knowledge and information about available resources and to help them utilise those resources to their maximum benefit. </P>
<P>47&#9;Implementation must be a participatory process. This strengthens collective community development and local reconstruction and development initiatives.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Simplicity and efficacy</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>48&#9;The policy should be simple, efficient and fair to ensure that the allocated resources are utilised to the maximum benefit of the recipients.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Cultural appropriateness </P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>49&#9;The services developed as a result of this policy should be responsive to the religious and cultural beliefs and practices of the community in which the services are provided.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Community-based</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>50&#9;In consultation with appropriate ministries, community-based services and delivery should be strengthened and expanded to have a lasting and sustainable impact on communities.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Capacity development</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>51&#9;Those community resources that are developed should focus not only on delivery of services, but also on local capacity building, to ensure sustainability of programmes.</P></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Promoting healing and reconciliation</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>52&#9;The activities that emerge from this policy should aim to bring people together, to promote mutual understanding and reconciliation.</P>
<P>53&#9;The Act provides for two stages in the process of Reparation and Rehabilitation, namely, Urgent Interim Reparation and Final Reparation Measures.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>


<UL>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><LI>URGENT INTERIM REPARATION </LI></UL>
<DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>54&#9;Urgent Interim Reparation is the delivery of reparative measures to victims who are in urgent need. During the life of the Commission, urgent interim reparation was granted to certain victims. It was further recommended that all applicants be considered for this grant while awaiting final reparation. </P></DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P> </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Benefits</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>55&#9;It was recommended that beneficiaries be entitled to the following:</P><DIR>

<P>b &#9;Financial assistance in order to access and/or pay for services deemed &#9;necessary to meet specifically identified urgent needs. Payment will be based on a sliding scale according to number of dependants and need. Thus:</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>56&#9;Victims or their relatives and dependants who have urgent medical, emotional, educational, material and/or symbolic needs will be entitled to urgent interim reparations. </P>
<P>57&#9;Urgency will be determined in each of the above categories using a detailed set of criteria available to the Committee and the proposed government implementing structure.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3></DIR>

<P>Implementation</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>58&#9;The promulgation of government regulations on urgent interim reparation took longer than expected, which resulted in a delay in making this relief available. The time it would have taken for a multi-disciplinary implementing body (as originally envisaged) to be set up would, in turn, have meant further delay in delivering tangible reparation to victims.</P>
<P>59&#9;The Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee thus took responsibility for disseminating, receiving and assessing reparation application forms. Two committee members recommended a cash payment and made suggestions about appropriate services that the applicant could access. This information was forwarded to the President’s Fund in Pretoria. The President’s Fund made payment to the applicant, either via electronic bank transfer or a cheque posted by registered mail and, through a network of nodal points in provincial governments, informed applicants of available services.</P>
<P>60&#9;While this system was being implemented (first payments were made in July 1998), ongoing discussion took place about the constitution of the implementing body that would eventually take over from the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee. This matter had not been finalised at the time of reporting. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Implementation of Urgent Interim Reparations before the date specified by the President in terms of section 43(1)</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>61&#9;This section outlines the different ways in which urgent interim relief policy was implemented before the date specified by the President in terms of section 43(1).</P>
<P>62&#9;Regional Human Rights Violations Committees made preliminary findings on victim statements gathered from their areas. Preliminary regional findings were considered by the national Human Rights Violations Committee and were either accepted or rejected. If the Human Rights Violations Committee found that a gross violation of human rights had occurred and was of the opinion that a person was a victim of such a violation, it referred the statement of the person concerned to the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee. Moreover, if the Amnesty Committee granted amnesty in respect of any act and was of the opinion that a person was a victim of that act, it referred the identified individual to the Human Rights Violations Committee which, if it concurred, referred the matter to the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee. In addition, if the Amnesty Committee did not grant amnesty for an act and was of the opinion that the act was a gross violation of human rights and that a person was a victim in the matter, it referred the matter to the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee through the Human Rights Violations Committee. </P>
<P>63&#9;Any person referred to the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee, in terms of the steps outlined above, was entitled to apply for reparation on the prescribed form that was sent to them. </P>
<P>64&#9;The Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee applied its mind to the information contained in the prescribed application form and other evidence or information of possible relevance in order to determine whether the applicant was a victim (that is, whether he or she had suffered harm in terms of section 1(1)(xix) of the Act), whether s/he was in urgent need and to identify the nature of the urgency. The final decision was based on the information contained in the prescribed application form. If the applicant was found to be both a victim and in urgent need, the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee conveyed this decision and all other relevant information regarding this application to the President’s Fund.</P>
<P>65&#9;Delivery of urgent interim reparation by the President’s Fund involved the following steps:</P>

<DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>67&#9;In acknowledgement of victim’s rights to reparation, it is recommended that final reparation involve an amount of money, called an individual reparation grant, to be made available to each victim (if he/she is alive) or equally divided amongst relatives and/or dependants who have applied for reparation (as defined above) if the victim is dead. The amount of the grant will be based on the formula outlined below. The formula is based on three components, namely an amount to<I> acknowledge the suffering</I> caused by the gross violation that took place, an amount to <I>enable access to services and facilities</I> and an amount to <I>subsidise daily living costs</I>, based on socio-economic circumstances. </P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3></DIR>

<P>Rationale</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>68&#9;The individual reparation grant is an acknowledgement of a person’s suffering due to his/her experience of a gross human rights violation. It is based on the fact that survivors of human rights violations have a right to reparation and rehabilitation. The individual reparation grant provides resources to victims in an effort to restore their dignity. It will be accompanied by information and advice in order to allow the recipient to make the best possible use of these resources. Thirty-eight per cent of the Commission’s deponents requested financial assistance to improve the quality of their lives. In addition, over 90 per cent of deponents asked for a range of services which can be purchased if money is made available – for example, education, medical care, housing and so on.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Formula for calculating Interim Reparation Grants</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">11</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3> </P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>69&#9;The monetary package is based on a benchmark amount of R21 700, which was the median annual household income in South Africa in 1997. The Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee believes that this is an appropriate amount to achieve the aims of the individual reparation grant – that is to enable access to services and to assist in establishing a dignified way of life. The poverty line of R15 600 per annum was rejected as a benchmark, as this would be condemning victims to a life of near poverty, rather than one of minimum dignity.</P>
<P>70&#9;The actual amount that each victim receives will be based on an easily administered formula, which differentiates according to three criteria:</P><DIR>

<P>a &#9;an acknowledgement of the suffering caused by the violation (#1);</P>
<P>b &#9;an amount to facilitate access to services. Because services are less accessible in rural areas, those living in rural communities will receive a premium in this part of the grant. The difference is based on the assumption that accessing services in rural areas is 30 per cent more expensive than in urban areas (#2)</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">12</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>;</P>
<P>c &#9;an amount to subsidise daily living costs. This will be differentiated according to numbers of dependants and/or relatives, which will be capped at nine. In addition, because the cost of living is higher in urban areas, people living in urban areas will be favoured in this portion of the grant. The difference is based on the assumption that the cost of living in urban areas is 15 per cent higher than in urban areas (#3).</P></DIR>

<P>71&#9;Each portion of the formula is given a weighting or ranking as follows:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><P>#1= 50%,    #2 = 25%,    #3=25%    of total Interim Reparations grant.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>72&#9;The actual variation in amounts payable according to the formula and differentiation criteria is shown in the table.</P>
<P>73&#9;Using the proposed projections, no individual will receive more than R23 023 per annum (the maximum individual reparation grant). This maximum amount would apply to an individual, living in a rural area, who has nine or more dependants.</P>
<P>74&#9;The annual individual reparation grant should be calculated for each beneficiary and paid as 50 per cent of the total every six months. The annual payments will continue for a period of six years.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3></DIR>

<P>Administration/President’s Fund</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>75 &#9;The grant will be funded and administered by the President’s Fund. The President’s Fund will accrue resources through allocations from the national fiscus, international and local donations and earned interest on the funds. Based on the given policy and formula, and estimating 22 000 victims, the total cost of this policy will be R477 400 000 per annum or R2 864 400 000 over six years. The figure of 22 000 victims is based on the Commission’s Human Rights Violations Statement as the only point of entry.</P>
<P>76 &#9;It is recommended that the President’s Fund functions on an interdepartmental or interdisciplinary basis as a dual structure with:</P><DIR>

<P>a &#9;an administrative capacity to disburse the money which has been allocated;</P>
<P>b  &#9;a multi-disciplinary Reparation Panel to assess application forms and to advise appropriately. While the Commission is still in existence, members of the Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee may sit on this panel.</P>
