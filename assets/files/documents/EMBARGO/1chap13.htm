</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><LI>INTRODUCTION</LI></UL>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>This chronology seeks to record all major apartheid legislation as a context within which gross human rights violations occurred, but is not exhaustive of all legislation passed in the period under consideration by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (the Commission). Legislation of ‘independent’ and ‘self-governing’ homelands is given separately. The homelands chronology is not, however, as comprehensive as that on the legislation enacted by the South African Parliament. Much of the homelands legislation was similar to South African parliamentary legislation. In several instances it proved extremely difficult to trace and record all details of homelands legislation.</P>

<P>The chronology is divided into two parts: Part 1 examines legislation in South Africa while Part 2 focuses on the ‘independent’ states - Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei (the TBVC states) - and the ‘self-governing territories’. </P>

<P>The naming of legislation follows <I>Statutes of the Republic of South Africa Classified and Annotated from 1910</I> (Butterworths). Where an alternative name is in use, this is provided in brackets. </P>

<P>The <U>commencement</U>: date of the legislation is underlined and, where applicable, the repealing act is in italics. Where the legislation was still in force in September 1996, the name of the Butterworths title (subject category) is cited in upper case italics. Only the most important amending legislation (as this impinges on the mandate of the Commission) is cited. Where amendments contain extended detail which is relevant to the mandate of the Commission, appropriate references only are provided for the sake of brevity. Dates of some major events are included as historical landmarks; these are given in italics. </P>

<P>Note: For the purposes of this chronology, the term ‘black’ is taken to exclude coloured and Asian persons except where otherwise indicated. </P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>The legislation in this section is flagged as follows for ease of reference:</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Basic apartheid laws (A): </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>The most important legislation relating to segregation of race groups. </P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>Laws which determined racially based job reservation, employment practices and labour relations.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Security legislation (S): </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>The history of security legislation in South Africa is very convoluted. Only those laws mentioned in the <I>Race Relations Surveys</I> (<I>RRS</I> and <I>SRR</I>) and John Dugard’s <I>Human Rights and the South African Legal Order</I> (1978) are listed. In particular, those laws relating to the tightening up of detention legislation are included. Only a brief description of the various state of emergency regulations is given.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>Discriminatory legislation related to political rights, including freedom of movement of homeland residents.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Land and property (L): </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>Legislation referring to black rural areas and the homelands: Prior to 1913 in the three northern provinces and 1936 in the Cape, blacks were legally entitled to acquire land from whites in parts of the country outside the scheduled areas. After 1913 (for the Orange Free State, Natal and Transvaal, and after 1936 in the Cape) this was prohibited unless the purchases were in areas which had been recommended by various commissions for ‘release’ to blacks (Horrell 1978: 203).</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Education (E): </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>Racially discriminatory laws which relate to primary, secondary and tertiary education.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Urbanisation (U): </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>Legislation concerning freedom of movement issues and land ownership in white urban areas. See also ‘political representation’ above.</P>

<P>1952&#9;&#9;Black (Native) Laws Amendment Act No 54:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>U</B>&#9;The 1945 Urban Areas Consolidation Act was amended to specify that all black </P><DIR>

<P>persons, men and women, over the age of sixteen were to carry passes and that no black person was to be allowed to stay in the urban areas longer than seventy-two hours unless they had permission to do so. Section 10, which governed who could stay in the urban areas, stated that black people who had been born in the urban areas and had lived there continuously since then, and those who had been in continuous employment for ten years or continuous residence in the urban areas for fifteen years, were the only categories of black people legally entitled to stay in urban areas (Dugard 1978: 74; Horrell 1978: 173). Powers of authorities were widened to include the ordering of the removal of blacks deemed to be ‘idle or undesirable’ even though they were lawfully in an urban area (s 29 of the 1945 Urban Areas Consolidation Act). If found guilty, a person could be sent to her/his homeland, to a rehabilitation centre or to a farm colony for a period not exceeding two years. Section 29 of the 1945 Urban Areas Consolidation Act permitted the arrest, without a warrant, of any black person believed to be ‘idle or undesirable’. In 1956, a new section was added to s 29, (i.e. s 29 <I>bis</I>) allowing for ‘the removal of an African from an urban area ... where his presence was detrimental to the maintenance of peace and order in any such area’ (Dugard 1978: 77). Because the purpose of this new s 29 was ‘to confer upon local authorities arbitrary powers to rid themselves of &quot;agitators&quot;,’ this new provision (unlike s 29 of Act 25 of 1945) did not ‘provide for an appeal against a banishment order’ (Dugard 1978: 77). (The provisions under this Act are extremely complicated. For a full description see Horrell 1978: 171-95.)</P>

<DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>S</B>&#9;According to Horrell (1978: 473), this Act signalled the beginning of the struggle against ‘Red arms’ as opposed to purely ‘Red ideology’. It authorised indefinite detention without trial on the authority of a policeman of or above the rank of lieutenant colonel. The definition of terrorism was very broad and included most criminal acts. No time limit was specified for detention; it could be continued until detainees had satisfactorily replied to all questions or no useful purpose would be served by continued detention. Fortnightly visits by magistrates were provided for ‘if circumstances permit’. No other visitors were permitted. The Act was operative retrospectively to 27 June 1962 and also applied to South West Africa retrospectively (Horrell 1978: 445). It differed from the ninety-day and 180-day detention laws in that the public was not entitled to information relating to the identity and number of people detained under the Terrorism Act (Dugard 1978: 118).</P></DIR>

<UL>
</I></FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><LI>PART II: HOMELANDS</LI></UL>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>
<B><P>Introduction: Self-governing territories and independent homelands</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1>
<P>The major pieces of legislation governing both the ‘independent homelands’ and the self-governing states were the National States Constitution Act 21 of 1971 and the National States Citizenship Act No 26 of 1970. (Both of these Acts were repealed by Schedule 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act No 200 of 1993.)</P>

<P>The legislative powers of the self-governing territories were contained in section 30(1) of the National States Constitution Act 21 of 1971. Any national state which was self-governing was entitled to ask for full independence from the Republic.</P>

<P>The Act made provision for three stages of autonomy: Homelands could progress from territorial authority status, in which no legislative power was conferred to the territory, to responsible government (the second stage) to self-government (the third stage).</P>

<P>The final stage of full independence was catered for in the National States Citizenship Act 26 of 1970. This Act provided for the establishment of ten so-called homelands to which eventually all black South Africans were to belong as citizens according to their ethnic, linguistic and cultural affiliation. This policy of denationalisation may be traced back to even before the National Party came to power in 1948.</P>

<P>Self-governing national states had their own symbols of state such as a national flag, anthem, and official language. Their legislation could repeal or amend any law listed in Schedule 1 of Act 21 of 1971, including Acts of the South African Parliament dealing with such matters. </P>

<P>No new South African law relating to Schedule 1 matters was applicable once the territory had become self-governing. This included Acts of Parliament but excluded laws made by the State President or any section 6(2)(a)(ii) or (iii) Act or ordinance. South African laws remained fully applicable in matters <I>not</I> listed in Schedule 1. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>The constitutions of the homelands were based solidly on the South African Constitution. The president was elected by the National Assembly. The Constitution expressly provided that the president of a homeland possessed the same powers by virtue of prerogative as the South African President possessed at the time when the Constitution came into operation, and the conventions applicable in South African law continued to apply. </P>

<P>The legislature of the self-governing territory was composed of the president and the National Assembly. The latter body was not wholly elected: half the members were elected and the rest were traditional headmen and chiefs.</P>

<P>In each of the independent homelands, government-paid, nominated chiefs formed at least half of the parliament and dominated the various cabinets. They wielded inordinate power over the people under their jurisdiction and were one of the key methods of control. This in itself was a substantial restraint on democratic opposition to the system; consent was engineered through the chiefs and an armoury of security laws backed by the police, who earned a reputation for heavy-handedness.</P>

<P>The homelands’ claim of ‘independence’ from South Africa was generally ridiculed. On the surface, all the trappings of a sovereign state were there: parliament, government and judiciary, even military forces and diplomatic missions, though ambassadors were exchanged only with the other independent homelands and with the Republic of South Africa. In reality, however, all were totally subservient to Pretoria. This was quite obvious in the economic sphere - the homelands formed a monetary and customs union with South Africa. </P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Security Legislation of the Homelands:</P>
</I>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1><P>It is in the security sphere that the independent homelands demonstrated their willingness and ability to pass and administer legislation to great effect. In legal terms, the four independent homelands had complete sovereignty, with their own police and defence forces to administer laws operative in those areas. The Ciskei government, for example, had the power to implement laws and detain people, even in the case of a family feud, and the Transkei re-imposed a state of emergency in July 1983 with extensive powers not subject to any judicial control.</P>

<P>In the non-independent self-governing territories the security laws were the same as those for the rest of South Africa, but in some cases the control of the police within the territories was transferred to the homeland government. In KwaZulu, for instance, control of the police was transferred in 1983 to the then Minister of Police, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who was also Chief Minister of the territory. </P>

</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Notes to the chronology of homelands legislation </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=1>
</B></I><P>Listings related to the independent homelands are given in alphabetical order followed by those of the self-governing homelands, also alphabetically.</P>

<P>With the independent homelands, the focus is on the security legislation, particularly where it differed from that of South Africa. Security matters were, however, also addressed through regulations and proclamations, which proved difficult to trace in many instances. While specific attention is given to emergency regulations, the inventory does not fully cover other security regulations or proclamations. </P>

<P>In the case of the self-governing homelands, all the legislation has been listed since it did not differ significantly from that passed by the South African Parliament. It has proved very difficult to describe this legislation the laws themselves were very difficult to access. Security orders passed by the self-governing territories are not listed here as the chronology focuses only on legislation, not subordinate legislation. </P>

<P>The legislation of the homelands was not all repealed by a single act, but has been and is being repealed piecemeal. As a result, the repeal dates of legislation have not been included here. </P>
