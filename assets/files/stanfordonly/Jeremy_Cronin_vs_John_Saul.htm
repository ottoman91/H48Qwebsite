Post-apartheid South Africa
a reply to John Saul

By Jeremy Cronin(1)

John Saul has had an extensive and committed involvement with Southern
Africa.    His analyses are taken seriously in left circles in South
Africa.  Sadly, perhaps understandably, his most recent extended visit to
this country has left him feeling deeply disappointed  ("Cry for the
Beloved Country: The Post-Apartheid Denouement", MONTHLY REVIEW, volume
52, no.8, January 2001, pp. 1-51). This sense of disappointment is rooted,
I would guess, partly in the intellectual, organizational and even
emotional energies that Saul, like many others, invested in the solidarity
struggle against apartheid, and in legitimate expectations for a
post-apartheid South Africa.  There is also, and I want to underline my
own empathy with his irritation on this score, a hint of personal hurt:
"The most startling thing I personally discovered about the New South
Africa is just how easy it has become to find oneself considered an
ultra-leftist!" (p.1) This sense of disappointment, even of betrayal, is
also present in many progressive circles within South Africa, and indeed
among many cadres of our movement.  Despite all of this there is, I
believe, something seriously off-beam in Sauls analysis.

Sauls article has two layers, two sensibilities, two organising paradigms
running through it.  To borrow and amend Gramscis epigram, we have, woven
imperceptibly together, a healthy pessimism of the intellect, and a
problematic cynicism of the will.

On the one hand, there is a relatively nuanced analysis of the complexity
of the South African negotiated transition and its legacy on the post-1994
situation.  I do not think that Saul would disagree fundamentally with,
for instance, the South African Communist Party (SACP) characterization of
the underlying determinants of the negotiated transition.  These
determinants were both positive and negative for the liberation movement.
The apartheid regime was brought to the negotiating table by sustained,
semi-insurrectionary mass struggles that had rolled-on, in a series of
waves, from 1976 through to the democratic elections of April 1994;
growing international isolation, notably financial and arms sanctions,
mobilized by an outstanding global solidarity network; a deepening
structural crisis of South African capitalism; and a shifting balance in
the conventional armed forces equation in Southern Africa, marked by the
defeat of apartheid troops by Cuban and Angolan forces around Cuito
Cuanavale, in southern Angola in 1987.

There was another factor, fraught with dangers for the liberation
movement, but which also served to weaken the strategic trajectory of the
apartheid regime.  With the waning of the Cold War, there was, from the
side of the major imperialist powers, a relative (but not complete) shift
of strategy from supporting regional gendarmes in the South.
Increasingly, through the late 1970s and into the decade of the 80s,
domination of the South was exercised through financial control, and the
concomitant fostering of negotiated transitions to "centrist",
elite-pacting, dispensations, producing "democratic" governments capable
of driving through macro-economic austerity, liberalization and
privatization measures with a degree of local legitimacy.

These factors all served to weaken the increasingly militarized apartheid
white minority ruling bloc, but there were other factors that compelled
the ANC-led liberation movement to look seriously at negotiations.  The
Southern African frontline states that had supported the South African
struggle (unevenly, but, in several cases generously and heroically) were
increasingly taking strain due to vicious apartheid destabilization, the
crippling impact of enforced structural adjustment programmes, and
internal weaknesses and bureaucratization.  The stagnation, then collapse
of the Soviet bloc, had a major impact on the strategic calculations of
the liberation movement.  There were other considerations as well, the
sustained wave of semi-insurrectionary struggles never really succeeded in
projecting mass power out of the spaces of racialized exclusion (the black
township and rural ghetto, the segregated black campus, or segregated
public transport, or place of worship) into the commanding heights of
political and economic power.  The maximum weapon of the working class was
the stay-away.  There were consumer boycotts, train and bus boycotts,
school boycotts and rent boycotts.  Mass power tended to be exercised as a
temporary (but never permanent) withdrawal, by using the spaces of racial
exclusion (which were always simultaneously related to capitalist
inclusion) to inflict losses on the core centres of economic and political
power.  Apartheid was rendered unworkable, and increasingly unprofitable,
but power was not about to be "seized".  The regime retained a massive
monopoly of repressive power, and the security forces remained relatively
intact and effectively organized.  In the early 1990s the SACP (again
borrowing a phrase from Gramsci) characterized the situation as one of
"reciprocal siege".

I have very briefly rehearsed all of this to underline the relative
complexity of the factors underpinning the negotiated transition.  The
balance of forces was far from being simply favourable, and this has left
an inevitable legacy on the post-1994 transformation process.  On the
whole, and Saul seems to agree, in the first four years of the 1990s, the
ANC manoeuvred skilfully on the terrain of the negotiations themselves,
exposing the regimes dual strategy (negotiations coupled with a ruthless
and intensified low intensity conflict), winning effective global and
national support for our basic demands, and sustaining (although
unevenly), rather than demobilising (as Saul suggests), mass activism
throughout the negotiations.  This ensured that the negotiations were
never reduced comfortably to an elite pact.  Mass mobilization served not
just to reinforce the national negotiating strategy, but also,
increasingly acquired its own localised and sectoral negotiating demands
on the shop-floor, in the village or municipality.

Since the first non-racial elections of April 1994, Saul correctly
observes that:

[INDENTED QUOTATION] it is important to repeat the point about just how
much of an advance has in fact been madethrough the 1994 election and its
aftermath, South Africa has been able to realize and to stabilize
institutionalised democratic order  making peace without suffering the
potentially crippling backlash from the right wing, both black and white,
that many had predicted and without suffering the collapse into chaos or
dictatorship that some had seen to be threatened by the establishment of
majority ruleA cause for celebration, surely, on a continent where
apparently less contradictions have proven far more difficult to resolve.
(p.4-5) [END INDENTED QUOTATION]

Nevertheless, despite the real constraints and despite the very real gains
particularly in the area of consolidating democratic institutions, Saul
goes on to argue that the ANC liberation movement has erred seriously on
two critical fronts  the choice of economic policies, and the relative
demobilization of our mass constituency (except during electoral
campaigns).  I agree with Saul on both counts.  Indeed, the ANCs alliance
partners (the SACP and COSATU) have, especially since the mid-1996
unveiling of governments macro-economic austerity policies, continuously
argued against this policy choice.  In regard to the serious decline in
popular mobilization, this is an organizational self-criticism that has
been made by all the alliance partners, not least the ANC itself.  There
are many reasons for it - statist illusions (that change could be
delivered from above by government alone), the unbalanced deployment of
thousands of former key grass-roots organisers into government, parastatal
and security force structures; growing "social distance" between much of
the ANC cadreship and its constituency, linked to the demographic impact
of social transformation and progress itself.  Much greater social
mobility has meant that township children are no longer necessarily
confined to ghetto schools, and skilled black professionals have moved to
formerly white suburbs.  All of this has had its impact on the coherence
and resourcing of grass-roots structures in our mass constituency.  These
dynamics have all been analysed in many ANC and alliance workshops and
policy-forums and a range of practical measures are being taken to address
the challenge; there are also objective limits, which are now beginning to
be apparent, to the actual numbers of cadres who can be accommodated
within an emerging elite.

There is much by way of emphasis and detail that I would want to qualify
or amend, but I agree substantially with the broad analysis of the last 12
years or so in South Africa that Saul makes in his
pessimism-of-the-intellect mode.  So whats the problem?  The problem is
that this general analysis is continuously trumped by another paradigm,
another sensibility.  This second approach is announced in the very title
of the article, "Cry for the Beloved Country: The Post-Apartheid
Denouement", and in the opening paragraph: A tragedy is being enacted in
South Africa, as much a metaphor for our times as Rwanda and
Yugoslavia"(p.1) Note the literary and rhetorical flourishes "denouement",
"tragedy", "metaphor", and a title that evokes the novel (CRY THE BELOVED
COUNTRY) by the doyen of white South African liberalism, Alan Paton.  They
announce a paradigm of imminent closure, the revolution that is about to
be (has always been about to be) betrayed.  This is Greek tragedy, and as
Brecht said of such tragedy, it renders the spectator a passive observer.
All we can do is emote, as Saul himself says: "One does not know whether
to laugh or cry..." (p.1)

But the imposition of this tragic reading onto what is, in my opinion,
still a relatively open-ended, complex and highly contested reality
results in a number of internal disjunctures in the course of Sauls
article.

In the first place, there are contradictory assertions.  Thus, on the one
hand, the critical indicator of the "defeat" of the revolution in South
Africa is said to be the "stabilization of capitalist relations".

[INDENTED QUOTATION]...defeat would seem to be an appropriate description
of what has transpired during the past decade in South Africa.  For the
stabilization of capitalist relations is, by any measure, one clear
attribute of the countrys transition.(p.3) [END INDENTED QUOTATION]

But a key feature of a semi-peripheral capitalist economy, like South
Africas, is precisely its unstable, crisis-ridden character.  Saul, later
in the article, makes precisely this point (see p.20).  In this context he
quotes Colin Bundys appropriate riposte to those who argue that advocacy
of socialism requires a leap of faith.

[INDENTED QUOTATION] to imagine that [through] a milder mannered
capitalismSouth Africa can somehow be absolved of its economic history and
enter a future like that of Sweden or Taiwan: now that REALLY requires a
leap of faith. (cited pp.21-2) [END INDENTED QUOTATION]

I agree absolutely, but then what are we to make of the earlier claim that
the key indicator of defeat in South Africa is the incontestable
stabilization of capitalist relations?  Perhaps Saul will respond by
distinguishing between a short-term stabilization and a medium- to
longer-term instability of South Africas semi-peripheral capitalism.  But
then the "defeat" (if that is the right word) of the left is also
provisional, rather than tragic.

This first disjuncture is directly related to the second.  There is a
consistent asymmetry in the way in which the programmatic perspectives and
achievements of the progressive forces are treated by Saul (often with
derision), and the way in which the aspirations of the neo-conservatives
are portrayed  (invariably as established and stabilized fact).

In the run-up to the 1999 elections, for instance, the neo-liberal
think-tank, the Centre for Development and Enterprise, brought out a major
report, sponsored by SA Breweries, POLICY-MAKING IN A NEW DEMOCRACY.
Although its title promised to focus on policy-making, this is not what
the report was fundamentally about.  It was much more radical in its
ambitions.  It advocated a major reconfiguration of the South African
political landscape - a made-over ANC, under the leadership of a
"managerialist" Mbeki, smashing its alliance with COSATU and the SACP and
forging a new bloc, made up of established big business, emerging black
business, and conservative rural black communities (those mobilised by
Buthelezis Inkatha Freedom Party, or by the independent, religious
movements, like the Zionist Churches).  It is no secret that in 1999, and
still today, established white capital in South Africa is insecure about
Mbekis agenda.  Wheedling in tone, the CDE report was seeking to woo the
soon-to-be-elected President Mbeki into playing the central (Bonapartist)
role in its project.  Saul (p.23) quotes from the report -- "business
leaders who have met Mbeki are positive, South Africa is fortunate to have
a person of Mbekis quality to lead it into the next century" - but
completely strips this fawning from its ideological project, and simply
presents it as factual evidence for Mbekis alignments.(2)

By contrast, when the general secretary of the SACP, Blade Nzimande, calls
for a deeper commitment to socialism, it is praised all too faintly as "a
radical-sounding" pronouncement (p.43).  The wishful thoughts of
neo-liberal policy institutes are treasured as factual gems, the
interventions of socialists are dismissed as mere rhetoric.  Readers are
told that the SACPs "self-definition" is "as an (ostensible) political
party that is at once both mere cheerleader for and occasional left critic
of the ANC"  (p43).  The SACP may well have limitations (although its
membership numbers have been steadily increasing, not declining as alleged
by Saul).  But it is not intellectually honest to claim that the SACP acts
(still less defines itself) as a "cheerleader".  Indeed, if the SACP were
simply a cheerleader, then what are we to make of Saul's earlier claim
that the language used by ANC leaders "to whip...allies into line was
harsh" (p.34)?  He is referring, amongst other things, to the SACPs 1998
10th Congress, at which both Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki tore into the
SACP with, indeed, extremely harsh language.  SACP delegates listened
respectfully to the critiques of our draft programme by the two most
senior ANC figures, and then proceeded to adopt every single contentious
paragraph  especially criticisms of governments illusions about the global
conjuncture, macro-economic policies and privatization proposals.  So much
for being cheer-leaders, so much for having been "whipped into line."

The progressive trade union movement is treated with the same derision by
Saul.  "The unions", we are told, have "clung to the Alliance", acting
'uncritically at election time" (p.36).  As anyone with even a passing
knowledge of the last few years would know, this is a gross
misrepresentation. COSATU, while, correctly, remaining committed to the
alliance, has played a leading role on many fronts, criticizing and
challenging ANC/government policies or the blunders of individual
ministers.  The most recent elections in South Africa were the 2000 local
government elections.  COSATU and the SACP played an active role in
shaping the ANC election manifesto.  In particular, we secured a manifesto
commitment to supplying a free basic level of water and electricity to all
households, breaking with the user-pays principle for which the World Bank
had successfully lobbied prior to this.  The ANC manifesto also committed
itself to legislating for localized institutions of direct democracy and
popular budgeting (ward councils).  Both measures are now in the process
of being rolled out  of course, with varying degrees of success, often
determined by the levels of local popular mobilization and capacity.

What is particularly irksome about Sauls derisive attitude towards the
SACP, COSATU and, indeed, the ANC, is that there is not a single
substantive critique of the South African situation and of government
policy in Sauls article that has not been consistently raised by the SACP,
COSATU and many in the ANC.  These perspectives are to be found in SACP
and COSATU congress resolutions, programmatic documents, numerous press
statements, public interventions, worker songs and slogans, and indeed in
action itself. SACP, COSATU and many ANC militants also raise their
concerns and seek to win their positions within the ANC and in a host of
ANC-dominated forums - from parliamentary caucuses to government cabinets.
These are not secret views, and Sauls insinuation that critical comment
tends to occur as often as not in private conversation (p.45) is another
unfortunate sneer. Governments macro-economic policy (the Growth
Employment and Redistribution framework  GEAR), privatization policies,
excessive liberalization measures, the failure to mobilise our mass base,
or concerns about growing bureaucratization and the influence of an
emerging black bourgeois stratum on policy choices  all of these,
mentioned by Saul, are consistent themes raised publicly, and not without
a significant resonance within the ANC and government.

------------------------------------------

Cronin v. Saul, 2/2 

-----------------------------------------

A third disjuncture, or rather reiterated trope, running through Sauls
article is what the South African literary critic and writer Elleke
Boehmer, in a somewhat different context, has neatly called the
"foreclosure of the frozen penultimate".  Every policy pronouncement by
the ANC, every opinion about the ANC from the outside, is read as a
portent of the inevitable "sell-out", which, like the Second Coming, is
immanent, always-already amongst us.  Sauls text is littered with
penultimates: "the virtual collapse of the ANC as a mass political
organisation" (p.9).  Progressive advances (like the Reconstruction and
Development Programme of 1994) are presented as "one last throw of the
dice" (p.17).  Tactical concessions made in the negotiations period are
said to have "firmly cast the die for future policies".  The major
transport parastatal Transnet (I will return to it below) is "one of South
Africas biggest soon-to-be privatized companies" (p.37).

Underpinning the disjunctures and the frozen penultimates is, I think,
Sauls deep scepticism about the wisdom of progressive forces in South
Africa persisting with the ANC. This, at the end of the day, is what
informs his dismissive attitude towards the majority within the
actually-existing South African left, "wedded" as this majority is to
"time-honoured icons and homilies" (p.43).  Nothing short of leading the
"left" out of its "bondage" to the ANC will, one suspects, begin to
satisfy Saul.  He may, of course, prove to be correct strategically, there
are few guarantees in real life struggles. It is possible that the
majority of the left, having played a leading role in building, organizing
and ideologically influencing the ANC, is now too sentimentally or
existentially enmeshed in its history to recognize that there is no longer
a radical transformational potential within the ANC.  It is possible, but
I do not remotely think so.

Indeed, from his side Saul is extraordinarily imprecise about any feasible
alternative organizational strategy.  He appears to advocate a "kind of
(small 'a') alliance of organizations of the dispossessed" (p.40).  He
draws on Canadian trade union activist Sam Gindins call for a "structured
movement", "something transitional that is more than a coalition and less
than a party."     He cites, with some excitement, an article from the
South African FINANCIAL MAIL about an emerging "popular alliance from
below" (p.42).  But then he is forced to concede that the new grouping is
"still described by the FINANCIAL MAIL as being located within the ANC
family" (precisely) (p.42).  In the end, he concludes this section of his
argument admitting that: "As for the longer run, it is quite simply
premature to say where a revived popular movement of the sort anticipated
here might eventually fit into the South African political equation."
(p.42)

If he is so unsure, then he should be less impolite about those who
believe that the revived popular movement will fit into (already is
within) the ANC alliance. It would be a real tragedy if the left in South
Africa declined to rise to the challenges of its actual achievements. The
ANC-aligned left (as even the FINANCIAL MAIL knows) is strongly present in
the (now somewhat destabilised but re-emergent) popular and grass-roots
sectoral struggles of our country.  But it would be a betrayal to simply
retreat back into the social movement alone, for the left is also in
parliament, in government, in the security forces, in the Constitutional
Court, in the educational and public broadcast institutions, and many more
sites of institutional power.  Each of these is a site of struggle, to be
sure.  We are not alone in these places.  In each of these sites, the key
strategic struggle is between all ANC-aligned forces on the one hand and a
range of neo-conservative forces, ranged outside of and indeed within
these state institutions. But there is also a secondary contestation
within the ANC itself.  The struggle, at both levels, is to ensure that
popular mobilization impacts on governance, and conversely, that the
resources of parliament and the executive are deployed to empower popular
mobilization.  It would be a grave error for the left simply to retreat
out of the state and constitute itself solely as a social movement
opposition.

In many parts of the world, a key (often elusive) challenge for the left
is to translate a diversity of progressive energies and formations into a
majority electoral project.  In South Africa, the critical challenge is to
ensure that a relatively secure electoral bloc stays mobilized for ongoing
socio-economic transformation, and that its leading formations remain
democratic. For the majority of progressives in South Africa, it is
obvious that all of this requires an ongoing commitment to and engagement
with and within the ANC.

To draw these conclusions is not for a moment to be blind to the very real
set-backs that have been suffered, and the mistakes that have been made in
South Africa over the last several years.  In mid-1996, government
unveiled its Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy (GEAR).  The
actual document is somewhat eclectic, but, in practice its core features
were restrictive macro-economic and continued liberalization measures
("getting the fundamentals right"), in the belief that these steps would
be rewarded with substantial foreign direct investment flows, which would
help to boost growth to a sustained 5-6% by 2001.  Growth levels of this
magnitude would, so it was argued, then ensure substantial employment and
redistribution possibilities. All of this is relatively familiar
neo-liberal fare.  In the first years of GEAR the neo-liberalism was
partially alloyed with "black economic empowerment" measures, largely
directed at consolidating black participation in the upper echelons of the
capitalist economy.

In practice, the budget deficit reduction targets set by GEAR have been
over-fulfilled, with the deficit around 2%; and inflation, certainly
domestic demand-driven inflation, curbed well below 10% (although the
target band of 5-6% for next year looks increasingly unlikely, due to
rising import costs linked to a significant depreciation of the Rand).  In
the months before its actual unveiling, the task group preparing GEAR had
envisaged a 20% devaluation of the Rand, as a dramatic gesture of
good-will to the markets.  Unfortunately, the markets depreciated the Rand
by almost exactly that amount in the first six months of 1996, while the
task-group was still preparing the strategy.  Much of GEARs thunder was
stolen before it could be unveiled.

While the fiscal restraint "fundamentals" have been over-achieved, the
flows of FDI have been exceedingly disappointing, and growth has been
sluggish, touching just over 3% in some years, and currently around 2%.
More disastrous, however, are the other socio-economic indicators.  Over 1
million workers have lost their jobs in the formal sector since 1994.
While current levels of unemployment are contested, no-one disputes that
we have an extremely serious problem.  The most recent government figures,
which exclude all of those who are unemployed but not currently seeking
work, suggest an unemployment figure of around 27%.  A more recent study
(partly funded by the Department of Labour) finds that about 32% of the
labour force is now unemployed, on the narrow definition, and fully 45%
are unemployed if all those without work are included.(3)  South Africa
remains, along with Brazil and Guatemala, the most unequal society on
earth.  This inequality continues to be highly racialized  average African
income is R1 638, while average white income is R6 131.  However,
reflecting the rapid development of a small but not insignificant black
elite, intra-race inequalities are now at their greatest among Africans
with top African income earners earning 21 times that of lowest income
earners.  Amongst whites, the top earners earn 12 times that of the lowest
income earners (see ibid.)

Faced with deepening unemployment, poverty and inequality, and with
disappointing growth and investment, the GEAR policy framework has met
with persisting criticism from COSATU and the SACP in particular.  From
the side of its principal proponents within government, there have been
several adjustments in the face of disappointment.  Increasingly, GEAR has
been re-defined as a conjunctural stabilisation programme and not what its
acronym suggested it once aspired to be (a growth, employment and
redistribution strategy).  In this re-reading, GEAR was necessitated by
global turbulence and by a very precarious foreign currency reserve
situation in 1996.  Its "success" is now measured not in terms of growth,
employment and redistribution outcomes, but anecdotally and by way of
comparison - "whatever our problems, South Africas economy is not in the
same predicament as Argentina, or Turkey, or Zimbabwe", "GEAR has helped
us to survive the worst of global turbulence""(which may not be completely
incorrect).

The failure to attract FDI as promised, notwithstanding "all the
fundamentals being in place", tends to be explained by GEAR proponents as
the consequence of "subjective" factors - "perceptions", "Afro-pessimism",
negative market "sentiment" towards all "developing" economies, etc. The
possibility that our problems might be linked to the systemic and
objective character of global capitalism and our own semi-peripheral
position within it tend not to be sufficiently considered.  The emphasis
is on "marketing" ourselves better, convincing the world that South Africa
is not Zimbabwe, rather than on adopting anti-systemic measures.

The failure to attract sufficient flows of FDI into green-fields projects
has also led to a re-doubled interest in at least attracting investment
through privatization.  In the 2001/2 budget, government for the first
time projected privatization proceeds of R18 billion, with a further R22
billion in the following two years.  In short, faced with the failure of
GEAR as a growth and development strategy, its most active proponents have
tended to amend and adjust policy, without fundamentally changing it.

However, there is considerable policy instability and the ANC itself (in
contrast to government) has never unambiguously endorsed the GEAR policy.
Moreover, those in government who have been most responsible for the
policy are not dyed-in-the-wool neo-liberals.  They are, I think,
convinced that the austerity measures were essential, and that they were
the only feasible way to ensure the realization of the reconstruction and
development objectives we all share.  This creates considerable space for
an ongoing intra-ANC, and intra-alliance process of policy assessment and
review.  Indeed, besides attempts to adjust or recuperatively re-define
GEAR, there have also been more promising shifts.  The ANC National
General Council, a major policy review process that involved all ANC
branches and provinces, and culminated in a 2000-delegate conference in
mid-2000, resolved that some kind of "macro-economic stability and
predictability" (the acronym GEAR, lacking legitimacy, could not be named)
was a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic growth and
development.  This has opened up a helpful intra-ANC and alliance debate
on what, then, are the "sufficiencies", and this debate has shifted us
away from a neo-liberal focus.  The need for an economically active,
developmental state and a strategic parastatal sector is now a commonly
accepted perspective within the ANC and alliance.  Of course, this
perspective often clashes with the simultaneous commitment to realising
R40 billion in privatization proceeds over the three-year period from
2001.  In his state of nation address in February 2001, President Mbeki
called for a switch of strategic focus from the "macro-economic to the
micro-economic", and for increased spending on economic and social
infrastructure, while simultaneously promising a major privatization
programme.  The SACP welcomed, at least, the macro to micro switch and the
infrastructural investment emphasis. These are very much in line with our
continued call for a coherent, long-term, state-led industrial strategy as
the core component for any growth and development programme.

These challenges and contradictions played themselves out dramatically in
the course of 2001.  By mid-year, relatively good progress had been made
within the alliance in restoring a climate for more rational and comradely
economic policy evaluation and discussion. However, the privatization
policy remained a major point of contention.  At the end of August, COSATU
mobilised a relatively successful two-day national strike against
governments privatization policies.  The fact that the strike occurred on
the eve of the major UN World Conference Against Racism in Durban provoked
anger in many quarters of the ANC.  Sectors within the ANC leadership
least sympathetic to COSATU and the SACP seized the opportunity.  One
leading ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) member publicly pronounced
the alliance "dead" - although his views were promptly disowned by the
ANC.

However, in the months following the strike, alliance relations hit a low
point, with sometimes wild, public recriminations emanating from all sides
of the alliance.  In late November, the ANC circulated an extensive
document, NEC Briefing Notes on the Alliance, and 52 regional general
councils (RGCs) were convened country-wide to discuss the document.  To
its credit, the ANC not only took the debate to its regional cadreship in
this way, but it invited delegations of COSATU and the SACP to attend each
of the 52 regional discussions.  The briefing document ominously presents
the COSATU strike as a general strike against the ANC government, rather
than against aspects of policy.  It notes that some economic policy, like
GEAR, is contentious, but declines to discuss it on the grounds that this
is not really what the worker action was about, there is much more than
meets the eye in the current tension.  The document conjures up the
spectre of a "left" (the word was later changed to "ultra-left") tendency
with quasi-treasonable intent.  It is never very precise about where this
tendency begins and ends.  We are told that the tendency is "organised and
loose, conscious and sub-conscious".

Thankfully, the 52 RGCs of the ANC helped to restore greater sobriety all
round.  These councils unanimously re-affirmed the importance of the
alliance, and they called for better and more comradely management of the
alliance by the national leadership of all three formations.  The RGCs
also expressed a sense of alienation from government policy development,
particularly economic policy, and called for greater intra-ANC and
intra-alliance discussion on issues like macro-economic and privatization
policy.  This outcome has now laid the basis for a much better climate in
alliance relations, and the year 2002 has, indeed, begun with a series of
constructive alliance meetings.

Parallel with this policy and ideological roller-coaster within the
alliance, the actual material "restructuring of state-owned" enterprises
provided its own complexities.  In the course of the past 12 months,
government has had to re-nationalize the 20% Swissair share in the 80%
publicly owned South African Airways; the privatization of airport
security is now being reviewed and drastically restricted in favour of
bringing back the SA Police Service, in line with post-September 11th
international trends; in the publicly-owned Post Office, the
private-sector New Zealand strategic management partner has been fired,
for reducing rather than enhancing the economic and developmental role of
the post-office network; and the IPO for Telkom, which was intended to be
the principal source of the R18 billion privatization proceeds for the
year, had to be indefinitely postponed in the light of the depressed state
of the global telecoms market.  Government has come nowhere near its
budgeted R18 billion target from privatization proceeds.

Most of these developments represent a delay or an externally imposed
adjustment to the privatization policy, but there have also been other
more promising developments. In November 2000, the Department of Public
Enterprises, which is spearheading the re-structuring of SOEs, published a
policy framework document ("AN ACCELERATED AGENDA TOWARDS THE
RESTRUCTURING OF STATE OWNED ENTEPRISES"). For rail freight it envisaged
the concessioning off of the two most profitable and technically efficient
lines within the publicly-owned Spoornet stable Orex, the ore line to
Saldanha Bay, and Coallink from the inland coal-fields to Richards Bay.
The core of the remaining high-density lines was to be retained within
Spoornet, but less high-density lines were to be dropped, and potential
private sector concession operators sought.  This restructuring
perspective was proposed by Rothschilds Merchant Bank and the British
turn-around specialists Halcrow, brought in as consultants by the
Department of Public Enterprises.  However, since 1996 there has been an
important National Framework Agreement in place between government and the
unions.  It commits government and parastatal managers to negotiations
with the trade union movement ahead of any restructuring.  The NFA has not
always worked effectively (one of the grievances in the August COSATU
strike), however, in the case of rail, an extremely useful process was
undertaken. After some tussling, the foreign consultants were
marginalized, and the two government departments (Public Enterprises and
Transport), the senior management of the parastatals (Transnet, the
umbrella entity, and Spoornet), and the unions developed their own joint
technical task teams.  The teams modelled different scenarios, and their
impact on the economy, on sustainability, and on jobs.  In the end,
government has agreed to retain the entirety of the Spoornet rail network
in public hands, and the two most profitable lines will not be
cherry-picked by the private sector, but will, instead, be used to
cross-subsidise the broader network.

All of this relative fluidity is an indication, I believe, of the systemic
vulnerability of the South African semi-peripheral capitalist economy, of
the contested nature of the South African transition, and of the capacity
of the ANCs broad cadre, working class and broader mass base to impact,
albeit unevenly, on the trajectory of the liberation movement.  These are
all reasons to disagree with the thrust of John Sauls "tragic betrayal"
analysis.  There is one more reason, a seemingly anomalous but perhaps, in
this case, genuinely tragic reason to disagree with Saul.

By a cruel twist of fate, the newly independent South Africa finds itself
in the midst of an AIDS pandemic, with possibly one of the highest HIV
infection rates in the world.  Many, including the World Health
Organisation, agree that the ANC-led government, generally speaking, has
an admirable, integrated and comprehensive programme to address the
pandemic. In particular, the awareness and prevention sides of the
campaign have been enlightened and relatively effective. However, the
treatment side of the programme has suffered from serious prevarication
and incoherence.  A small but well-placed minority within the
ANC/government leadership are convinced by the AIDS dissident argument
that there is no HI virus.  These comrades believe that AIDS is caused
primarily by poverty and the diseases of poverty  repeated exposure to a
barrage of infectious diseases (malaria, TB, STDs).  Furthermore, so this
argument goes, the case for HIV is being pushed by powerful, transnational
pharmaceutical corporations.  HIV is a profit-seeking ideological
construct, not a proven medical fact.  This is not the official ANC or
government position  both have emphasised on numerous occasions that our
policies and programmes are actively premised on the "assumption that AIDS
is caused by HIV".  But there have been hesitations, uncertainties and
incoherence in the implementation of treatment measures, particularly in
regard to anti-retrovirals.  If we are to evoke the notion of a tragedy,
or of tragic irony, then it is here, but strictly only here, that it is
applicable.  The dissident view within our ranks is not held out of some
venal opportunism, still less out of a desire to pander to neo-liberal
circles in the North.  Quite the contrary, the hesitations around
anti-retroviral treatment have cost the ANC government, and especially
President Thabo Mbeki, a great deal of credibility in those quarters.  To
compound the tragic irony, the dissident view in our ranks is generally
advanced by those who have been least sympathetic to any "dissidence" on
the economic policy front.  All of this underlines that, contrary to Sauls
frozen penultimate assumptions about an inevitable betrayal to
neo-liberalism, anti-imperialist sensibilities run deep within the ANC,
and they are liable to emerge, sometimes in surprising and, in this case,
perhaps in tragically misguided ways.

2.  It is interesting to compare the views expressed in 1999 by this CDE
report with the most recent intervention by South African big business.
In a report published (in March 2002) by the SA Foundation, Business and
Economic Policy: SA and Three Other African Cases, we are told: The SA
business community is probably the largest and most independent-minded
private sector on the continent, yet its ability to win the issues it
cares about with government does not reflect this; and relations between
the mainstream business community and the ANC leadership (President Thabo
Mbeki in particular) remained coolMbeki and his advisers appeared to
distrust and dislike the private sector  Needless to say, the SA
Foundation report is no less informed by a class agenda than the earlier
CDE report.  I am not suggesting the claims made by the later report are
any more factual than those in the earlier report.
