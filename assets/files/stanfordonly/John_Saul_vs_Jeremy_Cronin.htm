Starting from Scratch?
A Reply to Jeremy Cronin

John S. Saul*

It is interesting that, on one of the two main fronts of inquiry
opened up in my original essay, Jeremy Cronin professes -- despite the
wounded tone he adopts throughout and for all his talk about my "frozen
penultimates," "sneers," and "derision" -- to be in considerable agreement
with me. This concerns my reading of the overall trajectory of
socio-economic policy that the ANC government has adopted since 1994. As
he puts the point, "Saul goes on to argue that the ANC liberation front
has erred seriously on two critical fronts -- the choice of economic
policies, and the relative demobilization of our mass constituency (except
during electoral campaigns). I agree with Saul on both counts." Indeed, he
adds, "I agree substantially with the broad analysis of the last 12 years
or so in South Africa that Saul makes in his pessimism of the intellect
mode," including, it would appear, my criticisms of the "Government's
macro-economic policy (the Growth Employment and Redistribution
framework/GEAR), privatization policies, excessive liberalization
measures, the failure to mobilize our mass base, or concerns about the
growing bureaucratization and the influence of an emerging black bourgeois
stratum on policy."

These are not small points and, coming from one so close to the
scene as Cronin, tend to reinforce my confidence in my own negative
reading of the neo-liberal socio-economic project embraced by the present
ANC leadership. Moreover, the further articulation of that project since
my writing of the original article in 2000 has merely confirmed this
reading, with further major adaptations to the neo-liberal paradigm
surfacing domestically: accelerated privatization; an apparent
indifference to rising structural unemployment; the marketization of
service delivery that makes such delivery unattainable to so many; and so
on. Moreover, at least equally telling is the extent to which South Africa
has emerged ever more clearly as point-man for global capital on the
continent. as, it would appear, that system's sub-imperial power there.
Though Thabo Mbeki, Trevor Manuel and Alec Erwin profess to have an agenda
for reform of the global market system in mind (even as they embrace it
wholeheartedly), in practice their actions both undercut more serious
challenges to that system from the Third World (as at the WTO meetings
earlier this year in Doha[1]) and mask, as novel and daring departures,
entirely submissive and market-friendly initiatives from the continent
that are of their own devising (such as NEPAD, the so-called New
Partnership for Africa's Development[2]). Meanwhile, the chief goal of ANC
free-marketeers seems to be to batter down barriers to South African-based
capital's own ambitious plans for expansion into the rest of Africa.

Would Cronin disagree with this further extension of my
argument?(3) Certainly such qualifications as he makes to this aspect of
my original presentation are relatively minor -- save for his extremely
strained attempt, in his concluding paragraphs, to extract some scintilla
of anti-imperialist consciousness and activism from Mbeki's frankly
bizarre handling of the HIV/AIDS controversy in South Africa. Of course,
one might then have hoped for some further explanation from Cronin as to
why this kind of progression of the ANC project has occurred. The ANC
leadership's own favorite excuse, as least for its economic policies, is
that the structure of the global economy simply permits no other choice.
By suggesting that the ANC has "erred seriously" in this sphere (he also
speaks, with reference to GEAR, of "mistakes" having been made!) Cronin
does at least acknowledge that other options were indeed feasible. But
does "erred seriously" really capture the dynamic of crystallizing class
interest and preoccupation with consolidating its own power that has
driven the ANC elite into both forging the alliance it has with global
capitalist players and disempowering its ostensible mass base. More
clarity regarding these processes -- how structural they are and what room
for maneuver they leave open -- is required before taking seriously
Cronin's favored political remedies for what ails post-apartheid South
Africa.

For whatever the degree of Cronin's agreement with me regarding my
socio-economic analysis (and regardless of the silences he also permits
himself with respect to that analysis) it is on the political front that
he stakes his central critique of my position. Unfortunately, in stating
his disagreements with me, he manages -- whatever may be considered to be
the merits of his own position -- to willfully distort my own, doing so by
means of three distinct (albeit linked) moves. His first, and broadest,
move is to claim that my approach is "cynical" (he identifies "a
problematic cynicism of the will," said to be negatively twinned to my
"healthy pessimism of the intellect") -- a claim reinforced by his
emphasis on my deployment of the term "tragedy" and his suggestion that
this too frames an almost entirely negative outlook on prospects for
humane outcomes in South Africa."(4) Thus, owing to my "imposition of this
tragic reading onto what is...still a relatively open-ended, complex and
highly contested reality," I am compelled (this is, in fact, his second
move in misrepresenting my argument) both to overstate the degree to which
neo-liberal capitalist hegemony has been established and to denigrate the
"programmatic perspectives and achievements of progressive forces" in the
country.

As it happens, I now rather regret deploying the term "tragedy"
(although, in truth, I only did so once in over fifty pages!) since,
apparently, it can be taken to imply that I regard as ineluctable a
certain downward spiral in South Africa. But the fact is that I neither
evoke any such denouement elsewhere in the article nor do I believe that
it accurately characterizes the situation on the ground. Indeed, Cronin
knows perfectly well (as will any reader of the original article) that I
have neither a grimly determinist view regarding the irreversibility of
global capitalism's hold upon South Africa nor a pessimistic view
regarding the viability of resistance to it in that country. His first two
points are, then, merely rather seedy ploys designed to set up the third
and most crucial point that he wants to make against me: my "deep
pessimism about the wisdom of progressive forces in South Africa sticking
with the ANC." Note, please, that this third point would make no sense at
all if I did not think that there are deep contradictions, economic,
social and political, within South African capitalism that make resistance
possible (even inevitable) and did not think, as well, that there are
genuine and vibrant "progressive forces" in South Africa capable of
fighting that system. Can anyone read my article and honestly argue that I
do not present South Africa as offering "a relatively open-ended, complex
and highly contested reality"?

No, the real debate is not about my "cynicism," "pessimism," or
"tragic" reading of the South African prospect. Really, for Cronin, it is
about the judgment he imputes to me that "there is no longer a radical
transformational potential within the ANC." Indeed, he continues, "Nothing
short of leading the 'left' out of 'bondage' to the ANC will, one
suspects, begin to satisfy Saul." Note again, however, that on this now
much more substantive ground of presumed difference of opinion there is
also little evidence in my original article to support Cronin's reading of
my position. I did argue that the stark contradiction between the ANC
leadership's chosen socio-economic priorities and the felt needs of the
masses are giving rise to real tensions that have begun to stoke the fires
of a new mass resistance (to neo-liberalism) in South Africa. But I left
open the question of whether such energies would ultimately find their
most effective expression within the ANC and its (capital "A") Alliance --
altering, even overthrowing, the current project of the ANC's leadership
from within -- or would, instead, have to be mounted from outside that
project. Of course, Cronin is ultimately forced to acknowledge this too of
my argument, finally reduced to suggesting only that I have all too rudely
underestimated just how much opportunity still exists to advance an
effective left project from within. Nonetheless, we have now been
permitted to reach the bed-rock of Cronin's actual argument: his defense
of the virtually exclusive primacy of the ANC and the Alliance as the
terrain for meaningful left assertion.

What is one to make of this? To begin with, it is worth noting
several illuminating "footnotes" that cast further light on the position
taken by Cronin in his MR response. One surfaces from a reading of the new
famous interview given (about the time of his fashioning his response to
me) by Cronin to Irish journalist, Helena Sheehan.(5) As it happens,
Sheehan was moved to interview Cronin by having read my original article
and some part of the interview is directed towards evoking his reactions
to that piece. What is especially interesting is that, in this and other
sections of the Sheehan interview, Cronin has much franker things to say
about the actual room for maneuver offered within the ANC family than he
concedes in his MR version. In this interview, for example, he speaks of
tendencies towards "the zanufication of the ANC" and of "a
bureaucratisation of the struggle" and concedes that "the neo-liberals"
represent "a powerful force inside the ANC" (though this group, he
insists, "has its own weakness"). He also acknowledges that there are, in
ANC practices, "elements of a brutal [and] very dictatorial dealing with
the left." Noting in this regard the publication of an NEC Bulletin
denouncing an "ultra-left conspiracy" within the movement, he admits that
he and others on the left "have been through a tough couple of years in
the NEC. We've been marginalised, shouted down, subjected to heavy
presidential attacks on us.... We've stood our ground but it's been hard."
Perhaps, in light of these admissions, Cronin himself might be "less
impolite," to use his phrase, to those (Cronin is quite willing to apply
the term "ultra-leftists" to them in his interview and other writings) who
begin to argue that the more assiduous pursuit of left alternatives
outside the ANC/Alliance is becoming both viable and necessary. For, even
if is arguable, it is far from "obvious" (once again, Cronin's word) that
progressive endeavor in South Africa "requires on ongoing commitment to
and engagement with and within the ANC."

And then there are the most recent of developments within the ANC,
developments that have directly affected Cronin himself and that can also
be considered to cast doubts on the adequacy of Cronin's MR argument: how
available can the ANC be considered to be for progressive assertion in
light of what has befallen Cronin personally in the wake of the Sheehan
interview? For he was soon under heavy fire within the ANC for the
effrontery of his criticisms and the whipping-boy at a highly publicized
meeting of the ANC's NEC that ended with his abject apology for the
remarks he had made in this interview. There has since been much debate in
South Africa as to how best to situate this incident. The initial attack
on Cronin (coming from the notorious right-wing demagogue, prominent
Kwazulu-Natal-based ANC politician Dumisane Makhaye) had a racist,
black-nationalist edge,(6) but there was much more to it than that. Was
it, observers asked, primarily about disciplining heterodoxy, even of the
mildest kind, within the ANC itself or was it about bringing to heel the
SACP within the Alliance? Something of both perhaps, although the most
immediate drama was a more personal one. For Cronin followed up his in
camera NEC recantation with the release of an extraordinary public
statement:

[INDENTED QUOTATION] The unqualified apology that I made to the ANC
National Executive meeting over the past weekend, for the contents of the
interview I gave to Dr. Helena Sheehan, was neither coerced nor tactical.
It has been made sincerely and as a matter of principle. In its approach,
tone, and in the discussion of many internal matters outside of our
organisations the interview was a mistake. What I most regret about the
interview is that the undisciplined handling of serious issues can,
precisely, undermine the fostering of robust debate, criticism,
self-criticism and unity within our movement, not least between communist
and non-communist ANC members. In the context of my own apology, the
unambiguous reaffirmation by the ANC NEC of its commitment to the right of
every member to raise and debate issues with and within the structures of
the movement is one I welcome and remain dedicated to fostering.(7) [END
INDENTED QUOTATION]

[NOT INDENTED] My own reaction (circulated widely on the Debate e-list in
South Africa) was immediate and I reproduce it here only because it is
germane to developing in the present article my response to Cronin's
overall position: "very sad -- surely one thing the often sorry record of
left endeavor during the twentieth century might have purged us of is this
kind of 'correct-line' bull-shit -- undisciplined be damned: I've read few
more depressing paragraphs in recent years (in fact, it seems to confirm
all my worst fears re. the ANC, the Alliance, and much else, as expressed
in the original article that Jeremy critiqued in his interview!)."
Similarly aghast was Sheehan herself, agreeing with me that she too had
"read few more depressing paragraphs in recent years. I thought that the
21st century would be different, at least in that way. It reads as if it
is Lukacs and the Comintern."(8)

Even more telling were voices raised by South Africans themselves,
the distinguished journalist William Gumede in the Sunday Times urging his
readers (in an article suggestively entitled: "Silence isn't golden in a
true democracy: The ANC is doing South Africa no favours by lashing at
anyone who dares to criticise it") to

[INDENTED QUOTATION] Be worried, very worried, about SACP deputy general
secretary Jeremy Cronin's grovelling apology for "uncomradely" public
criticism of the ANC. Be equally worried when two enforcers of the party
line, ANC Youth League leader Malusi Gigaba and ANC Kwazulu-Natal leader
Dumisani Makhaye, rage against those who criticize the government "under
the auspices of freedom of expression and debate" and get the party
bosses' approval....This kind of "disciplining" by the ANC party bosses
underlines the great pressure in South African society to conform and to
defer criticism for the sake of "unity" and "patriotism."(9) [END INDENTED
QUOTATION]

[NOT INDENTED] As Gumede continues: "The problem is that in the ANC the
exile culture predominates. It is one of excessive control, centralisation
or power, absolute loyalty and the discouragement of open electoral
contexts." Moreover, "a loss of internal debate in the ANC has important
implications for open debate in society. Quashing debate internally will
inevitably lead to a muzzling of debate in broader society."
Interestingly, this interpretation echoes themes raised in a number of
letters I myself received in reaction to my original article, notably one
from the (now late) Lionel "Rusty" Bernstein, for over fifty years a key
ANC/SACP activist. In that letter he thanks me for encouraging him to
think further about "what is now happening to confound our hopes,' about
what, in short, "went wrong?" His answer: "Somewhere in the transition of
the movement from 'home' to 'abroad,' that movement's leading cadre began
to view liberation as meaning [merely] the acquisition of state power" and
this "drive towards 'power' has corrupted the political equation in
various ways":

[INDENTED QUOTATION] In the later 80s, when mass popular resistance
revived again inside the country led by the UDF, [this drive] led the ANC
to see the UDF as an undesirable factor in the struggle for power, and to
fatally undermine it as a rival focus for mass mobilization. It had
undermined the ANC's adherence to the path [of] mass resistance as the way
to liberation, and substituted instead a reliance on manipulation of the
levers of administrative power. It has paved the way to a steady decline
of a mass-membership ANC as an organiser of the people, and turned it into
a career opening to public sector employment and the administrative "gravy
train." It has reduced the tripartite ANC-COSATU-CP [A]lliance from the
centrifugal force of national political mobilisation to an electoral pact
between parties who are constantly constrained to subordinate their
constituents' fundamental interests to the overriding purpose of holding
on to administrative power. It has impoverished the soil in which ideas
learning towards socialist solutions once flourished, and allowed the weed
of "free market" ideology to take hold.(10) [END INDENTED QUOTATION]

My point here is not to debate the wisdom of Cronin's own choices
in this affair or to score easy debating points off him, for purposes of
the present exchange, in the wake of his personal discomfiture.(11) We can
note, in passing, that he himself seems to have learned his lesson well,
announcing, in the first of his interventions made public since the events
-- and against almost all evidence -- that "by and large, the ANC and the
government have maintained consistent anti-neo-liberal positions on all of
the key issues of the day."(12) But, in any case, it is more important for
present purposes to suggest that Cronin's own fate further underscores the
likelihood that he has distinctly overstated, in his reply to me, the
space for left maneuver that the ANC as presently directed and
institutionalized makes available. Moreover, this is a point reinforced by
several documents released since the Cronin affair but bearing the marks
of that event. First a leaked internal document from the ANC Political
Education Unit fulminated against all those (especially various unnamed
"foreigners"[13]) who charge the ANC with "neo-liberalism," these
"anti-neo-liberals" said, rather bizarrely, to now be in an "unholy
alliance" with the neo-liberals themselves to "carry out a
counter-revolutionary offensive against the democratic revolution."(14)
Equally ominous was the tone-setting statement made by President Thabo
Mbeki to the ANC's Policy Conference of September 27, 2002 which attacked
the "ultra-left" without but also within the ANC. Noting that this
ultra-left (pretty much defined as anyone who criticizes the leadership's
policies from the left) "works to implant itself within our ranks" and
"hopes to capture control of our movement and transform it into an
instrument for the realisation of its [socialist] objectives," Mbeki then
advances the proposition, as regards ANC membership, that "I am now
convinced that we must also pay particular attention to the principle --
better fewer, but better"!(15)

I might add here that, in a much more modest way, I myself
experienced something of this same high-handed ANC/SACP treatment of
critics during my own recent visit to South Africa. I was there to
participate in several of the counter-conferences organized to contest the
World Summit on Sustainable Development [WSSD], but at a moment that,
coincidentally, also stood in the immediate shadow of Cronin's
recantation. I chose to give a university seminar in Johannesburg designed
to promote a discussion of my original argument in MR and of Cronin's
response, the better to frame, on the ground, the present reply to it. The
discussant was Raymond Suttner, like Cronin an ANC and SACP stalwart and
also, like him, an heroic figure in the pantheon of those who had put
their bodies on the line in the struggle against apartheid.(16)
Unfortunately, Suttner seemed uninterested in engaging with the substance
of my argument, choosing instead to caricature it and, with three or four
other rather senior ANC and SACP personnel who had come to the seminar, to
lend his voice to an attempt to carry out some kind of ritual humiliation
of me. Fortunately, other South Africans at the well-attended seminar
joined in helping me turn back this verbal assault. But, by the end of the
meeting, nothing like enlightenment had occurred nor had any real airing
of alternative views been encouraged to transpire. As one veteran of South
African debate, long used to being on the receiving end of such tactics,
said to me afterwards, now I knew what it was like to be "panga-packed" by
the ANC/SACP.(17)

This kind of encounter was discouraging, but a second indication
of ANC closure that I witnessed at first-hand in South Africa that same
week was far more dramatic. On Saturday, August 24, an all-day meeting of
the Anti-Globalization Forum, a counter-conference to the WSSD, addressed
by such luminaries as Vandana Shiva, Maude Barlow and Naomi Klein and
attended by hundreds of South African wound down. Those in the hall were
now to set out on a peaceful candlelight march from the University of the
Witwatersrand campus, where we were had been in session, to the main
police station in downtown Johannesburg in order to highlight the fact
that the right to protest was being rolled back in the days leading up to
the WSSD. (Substantial numbers of activists from each of three separate
movements -- Sowetans demonstrating against service cutoffs, landless
people and aggrieved former ANC soldiers -- has been rounded up and
detained in a manner reminiscent of the bad old days.[18]) However, only a
few yards off the campus we were met by a strong police line and, almost
immediately, by a brace of percussion bombs fired into the crowd. A young
Canadian comrade (Karen Cocq) marching near me in the crowd was hit,
suffering severe burns to her legs. The marchers did boldly rally and an
impromptu meeting was held, anchored by the always impressive South
African township activist Trevor Ngwane, before dispersing. For me,
however, the event -- and not least the scalding of Karen Cocq -- served
as grim wake-up call as to just what the post-apartheid state and its
"Zanufied" ANC leadership might be prepared to do, now and in future, to
defend its turf.

--------------------------------------------

Saul v. Cronin, 4/4 

--------------------------------------------
 
But if this was how that week in Johannesburg began it was to
close on a quite different note seven days later: with a large and
spirited march (well over twenty thousand people), on August 31, on the
WSSD Summit. This demonstration had been called in opposition to the
"official" march sponsored by the ANC, and only a week of tense
negotiations with the authorities had encouraged the latter to yield in
anticipation to the alternative march's growing size and scope and declare
it to be "legal." Setting out from the impoverished township of Alexandra
it covered, over a number of hours, the ten kilometres passage -- from one
world to another! -- to the wealthy center of Sandton where the summit was
being held. Meanwhile, the ANC's own march drew only a few thousand people
and quickly aborted, to be correctly described the next day as "a massive
flop" by one South African newspaper.

It was impossible not to be caught up in the excitement. En route,
I was stopped for a television interview by the well-known Canadian writer
and activist, Naomi Klein. She immediately asked the most probing of
questions, one I had myself been puzzling over in the week leading up to
the event. "As a long-time anti-apartheid activist in Canada," she asked,
"are you surprised to find yourself now participating in a march against
the ANC?" Many of us had suspected all along, I answered Klein, that it
might prove easier to lay formal apartheid to rest than to tackle the
capitalist-induced inequalities that were also part of the old order. But,
I continued, it was hard not to see in the energies of the thousands
surging forward on this day precisely the same spirit of resistance to
inequality and injustice that those of us in the anti-apartheid movement
abroad had been privileged to associate ourselves with in the 1970s and
the 1980s. Moreover, it was no accident, I reflected to myself later, that
such energies had come into focus against the ANC and its neo-liberal
policies.

For the chief protagonists of the unofficial march, both the
leaders and rank-and-file of the "Social Movements Indaba" central to its
success, were drawn from a range of increasingly well-organized
grass-roots initiatives that have surfaced in the past few years to focus
the involvement of people in active resistance to their own government's
bankrupt policies. Indeed, it is the groups driving such initiatives that
have begun to redefine the South African political landscape. They
include, amongst others, the Anti-Privatization Forum, the Soweto
Electricity Crisis Committee, the Treatment Action Campaign, the Western
Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, the Concerned Citizens' Forum in Durban, and
the Landless People's Movement, and much of their spirit and thrust is
captured in Ashwin Desai's recent book from Monthly Review Press, We are
the Poors: Community Struggles in Post-Apartheid South Africa, which can
be recommended confidently to all present readers.(19) But the mainstream
press has also had to take note of such developments, a fascinating
Washington Post article of a year ago focusing on the activities of the
Soweto Electricity Crisis Committee whose guerilla electricians illegally
reconnect those in the township whose supply has been shut off by the
authorities for non-payment. Moreover, the article gives voice to the
likes of Soweto-resident Agnes Mohapi:

[INDENTED QUOTATION]We shouldn't have to resort to this," Mohapi, 58, said
as she stood cross-armed and remorseless in front of the home as the
repairmen hot-wired her electricity. Nothing, she said, could compare to
life under apartheid, the system of racial separation that herded blacks
into poor townships such as Soweto. But for all its wretchedness,
apartheid never did this: it did not lay her off from her job, jack up her
utility bill, then disconnect her service when she inevitably could not
pay. "Privatization did that," she said, her cadence quickening in
disgust. "And all this globalization garbage our new black government had
forced upon us has done nothing but make things worse ... But we will
unite and we will fight this government with the same fury that we fought
the whites in their day.(20)[END INDENTED QUOTATION]

For all Cronin's deep sense of commitment I fear that, in the end,
the anger and urgency in Mohapi's voice simply finds too little echo in
his response. Equally instructive is the fact that Cronin makes no mention
of the "social movements" just cited in his reply to me, even though their
increased saliency was there for him to see by the time he wrote his
reply. Of course, such is the volatility of developments in South Africa
that it is not easy to keep abreast of their cutting edge. Take my own
original article. In it  I marked the beginnings of what I saw to be a sea
change in South African politics -- while noting (pace Cronin) both that
the process of building an alternative politics was only then beginning
and that it was far from certain whether the fresh stirrings of popular
discontent already visible would find their most effective expression
within or without the ANC and its Alliance. Still, I did argue the
importance of an emerging (small "a") alliance  capable of drawing the
trade unions into common cause with other actors in "civil society" (the
churches, SANGOCO, and the like) to bring genuine pressure to bear on the
ANC-controlled state (and, beyond that, on capital, world-wide and local)
in order to realize more humane and economically effective developmental
possibilities in South Africa. Ironically, the groups I had then
identified were the very groups that found themselves lured by the ANC
into endorsing its own abortive march on the WSSD instead of linking up
with the stirring demonstration of strength mounted by the Social
Movements' Indaba.(21) In short, since I wrote in 2000, it is the other
groups mentioned above that have stepped forward to give real substance to
the radical promise of "working-class civil society." It begins to appear
that COSATU and the NGOs will have to run to keep up with their sometime
constituency as that constituency now turns left.

In light of this experience it has become easier to embrace the
possible wisdom of those South African activists who do indeed seek to
"lead the 'left' out of 'bondage' to the ANC" than it was when I wrote my
earlier article. For, in fact, the ANC as presently directed and
constituted has little to say to such people and to such groupings. Nor
can one have any great confidence that, in this respect, the SACP will
overcome the inevitable ambiguities of its ties to the ANC: in but not of
it, without electoral purchase, and, although abused and disempowered
within the Alliance, offering nonetheless -- in the very fact of its
existence -- a convenient excuse for the ANC leadership to dodge any
leftist vocation of its own by consigning that remit to its ostensible
ally.(22) One might expect the bulk of the trade union leadership to be
even more promising potential tribunes for the people, but for them too
entanglement in the Alliance increasingly seems to be at least as much
snare as opportunity, a certain (valuable) recognition of union rights
traded off against far too little leverage to affect progressive outcomes
in most macro-policy spheres. Can one not then suspect, more strongly than
ever, that the ANC project, the Alliance project, is -- as one South
African friend suggested to me -- "exhausted"?

Perhaps, but, at the same time, I must refuse to be bullied by
Cronin into accepting the mantle of "ultra-leftism" which he proffers me
or seeing the situation as being less complicated than it really is. It
would be foolish, for example, to underestimate the strength of the ANC's
own continuing legitimacy, as the party of liberation, in many quarters,
and the extent to which it still focusses the positive energies of
numerous people who would nonetheless wish it were much more progressive
than it has become. As one senior ANC official insisted in a letter to me
in response to my MR article, the danger exists "of the left (defined in
this case as the labor unions, the SACP and independent Marxists of
various stripes and hues) isolating themselves on the left fringes of
society" and thereby "handing the movement over to the right to do within
it what it pleases": "If, as I imply, the ANC is itself a site of class
struggles, would it be the smart option to move out of it and by default
hand it to the rising waBenzis, or would it be smarter to contest their
thrust." And a recent news article brings a report that, in the run-up to
the ANC's national conference this December, "leftists" are indeed
lobbying to place many more "left sympathizers" on the NEC -- although
this same article suggests that President Mbeki's most recent attacks on
the "ultra-left" and the COSATU leadership are designed at least in part
to help preempt any such outcome.(23) And there is also the fact that the
process of "starting from scratch," if that is what is now required, will
be uneven, more pronounced in Guateng (the province housing Johannesburg
and Pretoria) say than in the Eastern Cape, where ANC hegemony is
especially strong.

Similarly, it would be naive to overestimate the strength and
unity of the new social movements, the breadth of their reach and of their
alliances, the clarity of their strategies,(24) and the current level of
their organizational capacity. There is, without doubt, a great deal of
work to be done in order to seal the promise of a more progressive and
appropriate politics in South Africa along novel lines, whatever these may
prove to be. It is true, for example, that many workers begin to sense
that wearing the political hat of their township and "social movement"
identities rather than that of their unions promises to give them more
effective leverage on power. Beyond this, some on the left may wish to
argue that -- in addition to the pull on many trade union leaders to
identify upwards in the power game -- organized workers more generally are
often just too well sited socio-economically within the increasingly
impoverished and polarized society that is today's South Africa to readily
identify downwards and outwards with the country's vast army of the
unemployed and the landless. And yet it would be foolish for radicals to
ignore the South African "working class" and the formidable trade unions
it has created: these unions' size, their organizational and financial
capacities, their long history of militant struggle. Vulnerability to the
assault of "neo-liberal" policies in post-apartheid South Africa is widely
shared, as many unionized workers have found out for themselves in recent
years. Finding a way more effectively to link trade unions and social
movements (in a "structured movement"? a political party?) for progressive
purposes is just one of the many challenges, barbed and unpredictable,
that must be on the agenda of the ANC leadership's critics.

The issues thus raised are much too vast to explore in a mere
"reply," of course. Let me conclude by simply stating that I feel, even
more strongly than I did in writing my original article, that we are now
entering onto novel and complex political terrain in South Africa, terrain
that is extremely dangerous but also marked by genuine promise. Certainly,
it is far too early to say that "the tide is turning," as one of the
leaders of the August 31st march from Alex to Sandton enthusiastically
shouted out to me along the route. Nonetheless, it was difficult to be on
that march and not sense that it served as a significant signpost on the
road to a post-neo-liberal and post-nationalist politics in South Africa
-- and as an impressive rallying point for those forces from below that
might yet get things back on track in their country.

2. See, inter alia, Trevor Ngwane, "Should African social movements be
part of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)?" a speech
presented to the African Social Forum's African Seminar at the World
Social Forum, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 2 February 2002 (circulated to the

3. Perhaps now he would. In one of his first interventions (Jeremy Cronin,
"No one is infallible: Jeremy Cronin argues that the ANC should be leading
the anti-neo-liberal coalition," Mail and Guardian (M&amp;G), October 10,
2002]) since his dramatic disciplining by the ANC (see below) he makes the
astonishing, even fawning, claim that "Through Nepad and through a wide
range of other multinational forums the ANC has been playing a role in
redefining global priorities, In doing so they have been challenging the
core assumptions of neo-liberalism"!

4. In his related interview with Helena Sheehan (see below) he,
regrettably, even plays a crypto-racist card, suggesting my intervention
to have been characterized by "a kind of northern scepticism, a northern
left scepticism, about the left project in general, not least the left
project in the south" -- this a rather odd and disturbing charge given my
own long history of advocacy of socialist efforts in Tanzania, Mozambique
and elsewhere. Odd, but also ironic in light of the fact that he himself
was to be "white-baited" in the wake of the Sheehan interview.

5. Second interview with Jeremy Cronin by Helena Sheehan, recorded on
digital video on January 24, 2002, and circulated as a transcript on the
"Debate list" and at other websites.

6. In a speech Makhaye referred dismissively to Cronin as "a white messiah
and a factory fault," stating more generally (with reference, some
observers reported, to the SACP) that "there are dogs who are biting the
ANC and these dogs are calling themselves our friends. The ANC would not
be defeated, the ANC is strong. Some of us are prepared to die for the ANC
and to kill for the ANC" (The Mercury, August 18, 2002).

7. Statement issued by Jeremy Cronin, SACP Deputy General Secretary and
ANC NEC member, August 19, 2002

8. Personal Communication, August 20, 2002. But see, also, the front-page
report of Sheehan's response to Cronin in The Sowetan, August 28, 2002,
under the headline "'No apology was needed: Irish academic disappointed in
Jeremy Cronin for having apologised to the ANC."

9. William Mervin Gumede, "Silence isn't golden in a true democracy: The
ANC is doing South Africa no favours by lashing at anyone who dares to
criticise it," Sunday Times, August 25, 2002; a much more demagogic
critique of Cronin's action was undertaken, from the right, by (then) Mail
and Guardian editor, Howard Barrell, who suggested (M&amp;G, August 23-29,
2002) that Cronin's "craven capitulation" marked the fact that he had
"merely turned tail and fled the battlefield onto which he had led
others": "And you, comrade Jeremy? We shall see what magnanimity await you
once you've said a dozen 'Hail Thabos'."

10. Personal communication, June 8, 2001.

11. Some have recalled, however, the active role Cronin himself played,
several years ago, in the expulsion of left author and activist Dale
McKinley from the SACP and suggested that Cronin, in that instance, may
merely have helped to sharpen the knife which, more recently, has been
pressed to his own throat. For McKinley's own pungent take on Cronin's
Sheehan interview, see his "A Polemical Reply to Cronin," distributed to
the "Debate" list, May 1, 2002.

12. See footnote 3, above. Moreover, Cronin was quickly to claim that this
statement was an internal document, leaked, without his knowledge, to the
press.

13. "In time," the document threatens, "we will explain who these South
African-based foreign enemies of the ANC are." This seems a particularly
tasteless nationalist smear in light of the absolutely central roles
played by activists, South African and black, like Trevor Ngwane, Virginia
Setshedi, John Appolis, Oupa Lehulere, amongst many others and alongside
ageless veterans such as M.P. Giyose and Dennis Brutus, in mounting the
resistance, both intellectual and practical, that found one of its most
dramatic expressions in the August 31st Alex-to-Sandton march (to be
discussed below).

14. ANC Political Education Unit, "Contribution to the NEC/NWC Response to
the 'Cronin Interviews' on the Issue of Neo-Liberalism," widely circulated
on the web but eventually published in edited form as "Unholy coalition
will not win: The ANC's Policy Education Unit charges that the left is
waging a counter-revolutionary campaign against the government," M&amp;G,
October 11, 2002. The document concludes by claiming that in order to
achieve its nefarious end ("a victorious socialist revolution") "the
anti-neo-liberal coalition is ready to treat the forces of neo-liberalism
as its ally"; it is difficult to attach any rational meaning to this and
many other assertions in the document. See also Christelle Terreblanche,
"Secret ANC paper slams 'unholy alliance': 'Anti-neo-liberal left' and
'pro-liberal Right' have joined forces against ruling party, venomous
document claims" (The Star, October 3, 2002).

Congress, Thabo Mbeki, at the ANC Policy Conference, Kempton Park,
September 27, 2002.

16. See Raymond Suttner, Inside Apartheid's Prison: Notes and letters of
struggle (Melbourne and Pietermaritzburg: Ocean Press and University of
Natal Press, 2001).

17. "Panga" is an African word for "machete." To be fair, in a subsequent
private chat during my visit Suttner proved to be a much more open and
sympathetic interlocutor. Indeed, one begins to feel that if the term
"tragic" applies at all in contemporary South Africa it is to the plight
of the Cronins, the Suttners and other uneasy ANC loyalists who are
increasingly caught between a rock and a hard place as the ANC moves right
and as the contradictions inherent in the SACP's posture of
fellow-traveler vis-a-vis the ANC intensify.

18. On events leading up to the August 24 abortive march, see Sarah
Duguid, "ANC 'behaving like Nat regime': The government's crackdown on
world summit protests has raised unsavoury comparisons," Mail and
Guardian, August 23-29, 2002.

South Africa (New York: Monthly Review Press, 2002); see also the
important recent contributions of Neville Alexander, Issues in the
Transition from Apartheid to Democracy in South Africa (Pietermaritzsburg:
University of Natal Press, 2002) and Gillian Hart, Disabling
Globalization: Places of Power in Post-Apartheid South Africa
(Pietermaritzburg and Berkeley/LosAngeles: University of Natal Press and
University of California Press, 2002).

20. Washington Post, November 6, 2001, p. A1.

21. To its credit, SANGOCO (the South African NGO Coalition) actually
dropped out of the ANC rally and march at the very last moment,
deeming these events to be too uncritically pro-government

22. This is an oft-repeated ploy, recycled in almost exactly these terms
by Thabo Mbeki in his recent speech, cited earlier. There, categorically
rejecting any possible socialist tainting of the ANC's "national
democratic revolution," he also makes the improbable claim that "our
movement, like all other national liberation movements throughout the
world, is, inherently and by definition, not a movement whose mission is
to fight for the victory of socialism" (emphasis added).

inclusion in the NEC of party members with strong activist credentials,"

24. Local, national, regional, global? Elections, demonstrations and
representations, symbolic acts of defiance, more dramatic forms of
confrontation?
